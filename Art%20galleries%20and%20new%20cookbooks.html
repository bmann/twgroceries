The show was just OK, at best. But this <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/2021/06/06/went-to-the.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full wall mural by Lauren Brevner and James Harry was amazing</a>. </p><img src="https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/uploads/2021/e0db224260.jpg"><p>We went to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="1931%2520Gallery%2520Bistro.html">1931 Gallery Bistro</a> upstairs from the art gallery for lunch. I had the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Avocado%2520Toast%2520at%25201931%2520Gallery%2520Bistro.html">avocado toast</a> and Rachael had eggs Benedict with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="halloumi.html">halloumi</a>.</p><img src="https://ipfs.runfission.com/ipfs/bafybeietxf4sq6obejyxl2ilhtxcthgr66lhudxjadv77ftxptnt3kq4g4/p/twgroceries/avotoast_1931.jpg"><p>After lunch we went to our appointment at the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Contemporary%2520Art%2520Gallery.html">Contemporary Art Gallery</a>.</p><p>Since we were still wandering downtown — a town day, after all this pandemic time! — we went back up to Indigo Books on Robson so Rachael could get a new journal.</p><p>Then a final stop at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Golden%2520Age%2520Collectables.html">Golden Age Collectables</a> on Granville. Lots of people browsing, including us, so we thought we should buy something. I bought <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="%2520https%253A%252F%252Fimagecomics.com%252Fcomics%252Freleases%252Fcrossover-vol-1-kids-love-chains-tp.html">Crossover, Vol. 1: Kids Love Chains</a>.</p><h2 class="">Sunday, June 6th, 2021</h2><p>Today has been fully overcast and rainy, including some absolute downpour moments. When the rain slowed to a light sprinkle, we walked over to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Laughing%2520Bean.html">Laughing Bean</a> for a cappuccino and an oat milk chai.</p><p>We got hit by downpours at one point, and we luckily had a covered spot on a bench outside to wait out several more downpours.</p><p>Rachael remembered that there was a sale on used / bargain books at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Iron%2520Dog%2520Books.html">Iron Dog Books</a> around the corner, so we had a nice time browsing.</p><p>I ended up with a couple of new cookbooks, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Heritage.html">Heritage</a> — covering “America’s heritage foods” — and a slim book called <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Classic%2520African.html">Classic African</a>.</p><p>A couple of other cookbooks looked interesting, but that I didn’t buy:</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="A%2520Facsimile%2520of%2520the%2520First%2520Edition%2520of%2520The%2520Joy%2520of%2520Cooking.html">A Facsimile of the First Edition of The Joy of Cooking</a> — the original 1931 first edition of The Joy of Cooking, re-printed in a small hardcover.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="On%2520Food%2520and%2520Cooking.html">On Food and Cooking</a> — looked really interesting, but it’s the kind of process, techniques, and basics that I’d love to have electronically in a “wiki book”.</p><p>Coming back home, we had a quick lunch. Rachael finished up the leftovers we had the other night from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Haru%2520Korean%2520Kitchen.html">Haru Korean Kitchen</a>, and I made a quick ramen soup out of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Amano%2520Organic%2520Aka%2520Miso.html">Amano Organic Aka Miso</a>, a carrot, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Lanzhou%2520Noodles%2520Ramen.html">Lanzhou Noodles Ramen</a>.</p></div>
