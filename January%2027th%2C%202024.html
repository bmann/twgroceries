Stopped in at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="billy%2520would%2520design.html">billy would design</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Doe%2520Coffee.html">Doe Coffee</a>, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Mucker%2520Next%2520Door.html">Mucker Next Door</a>.</p><p>Met Bori at Mucker. Cool name! She let us know that Mucker would be a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Glorious%2520Organics.html">Glorious Organics</a> CSA drop off location. </p><p>Raining a lot, but we kept going to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Columbus%2520Meat%2520Market.html">Columbus Meat Market</a>. Big line up. I got ticket 38 and 5 was currently being served. </p><p>I got 4kg of bone-in, skin on chicken thighs for co-cooking on Monday. Asked if they had any pork lard, which they didn’t, but they did give me a bag of pork fat for free. </p><p>I looked up how to render fat into lard and it doesn’t really need a recipe ;)</p><p>Cut the pork fat into small strips and dropped them into a crock pot on high. Took some time to heat up and then used a ladle to put into a jar. As many directions say, I have a large 750ml jar that is filled with snowy weight lard. </p><p>Dinner at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Pie%2520Shoppe.html">The Pie Shoppe</a></p><p>Before going to bed, I chopped up 6 yellow onions and dumped that into the reduced pork fat pieces with a little salt, whole peppercorns, and a couple of bay leaves. I was worried about leaving it over night so I added some water. </p></div>
