This would include Grandview-Woodlands area.</p><p>The area west of Woodland Park and south of Hastings is an industrial area that is starting to get a few little mixed use food production places.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Timbertrain%2520Depot.html">Timbertrain Depot</a> is probably the best coffee in the area. Has “Stadium” seating inside, but not a place to hang out. Get your beans here or a great drink, as well as really good baked goods, breakfast sandwiches, and even recently banh mi sandwiches. Go sit in Woodland Park!</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Porchlight%2520Press.html">Porchlight Press</a> does letterpress printing and other custom print jobs. They have a few really nice cards, notebooks, and other paper goods you can walk in and buy.</p><p>Around the corner is the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Earnest%2520Ice%2520Cream.html">Earnest Ice Cream</a> scoop shop, with a little parklet.</p><p>On East Georgia, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Coho%2520Commissary.html">Coho Commissary</a> is new. Has a cafe inside serving Elysian coffee. A few small tables inside, some really nice picnic tables outside. Croissants, fresh baked bread, and a few sandwiches.</p><p>Woodland Park is a big park with a neighbourhood garden and lots of places for laying out on the grass.</p><p>Adanac Street, a key east-west bike route, goes along the southern edge of Woodland Park. It has two breweries in the block just west of the park. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Bomber%2520Brewing.html">Bomber Brewing</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Off%2520the%2520Rail.html">Off the Rail</a>. There are multiple food trucks that are starting to regularly park there to feed the beer drinkers.</p><p>To finish off this corner of the map, the north west corner has <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Pink%2520Pearl%2520Restaurant.html">Pink Pearl Restaurant</a>, which is a classic big Chinese dining hall style restaurant, with dim sum on weekends including steam carts being pushed around.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Andina%2520Brewing.html">Andina Brewing</a> is one of many breweries with tasting rooms in the area.</p><p>South, back along busy Clark Street, you’ll find the classic <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Truck%2520Stop%2520Cafe.html">Truck Stop Cafe</a>. Classic diner with all day breakfasts, burgers and fries, club sandwiches, and a few Chinese dishes on special.</p><p>West of Clark from there is where many artist studios are. The Mergatroid building is one studio building, and just across from there are the giant and famous Parker Street Studios.</p><p>While Clark is busy and not nice to walk along, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Strange%2520Fellows%2520Brewing.html">Strange Fellows Brewing</a> is absolutely worth visiting. My favourite beer in the area, and they often have various art and lifestyle markets and events they host as well.</p><p>The main strip of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Commercial%2520Drive.html">Commercial Drive</a> starts at Venables. Right south of Venables you’ll find a cluster of great stuff. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Kin%2520Kao.html">Kin Kao</a>, refined Thai food that is excellent for dine in and take out. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Downlow%2520Chicken.html">Downlow Chicken</a>, always packed, take your order and go eat in Woodland Park.

Bread products are boring, fruit &amp; vegetables are just OK. Various natural / organic / vegan stores are all around.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Moja%2520Coffee.html">Moja Coffee</a> is usually pretty packed, so more of a good place for people watching than sitting and working at.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Kulinarya.html">Kulinarya</a> is a fantastic Filipino restaurant, one of the best in the city. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Havana.html">Havana</a> has the best patio on The Drive.

Really good fruits and vegetables, and in season lots of stuff in giant containers in from the Fraser Valley and Okanagan. Great deli counter with charcuterie and cheeses.

Excellent bakery, excellent pastries, excellent coffee. Brunch, lunch, dinner. Cocktails and drinks in the evenings too.</p><p>Tatsu is my favourite sushi on The Drive. Really creative presentation, super fresh, all the classics, and yeah, you’ll just be amazed at how some of it is presented.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Magnet%2520Home%2520Hardware.html">Magnet Home Hardware</a> is the everything store. Really good cooking (and beer brewing!) equipment, as well as a big garden section.

Really, should be called Yeast Van not just for beer brewing, but also for bakeries!</p><p>Teleporting back north all the way to Powell, you’ll find <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="The%2520Narcissus.html">The Narcissus</a> coffee shop.
