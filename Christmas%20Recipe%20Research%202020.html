I salted it the night before, then rubbed it with a meyer lemon and paprika, then sprinkled koji salt all over. </p><p>Into the oven at 350 rather than 325 because the door wouldn’t close with this big pan!</p><p>(image)</p><p>Started the gravy with necks and bits. House smelling delicious already. </p><p>(image)</p><p>Goose after 40 minutes</p><p>(image)</p><p>Yes, temperature is right where it should be - between 130 - 140. </p><p>(image)</p><p>Cut the breasts off. Doesn’t look pretty, felt like a hack job. </p><p>(image)</p><p>(image)</p><p>I flipped the goose and cooked for another 40 minutes, then cut everything apart and took all the meat off the bones. </p><p>Half for us, half for my parents. </p><p>The skin is nice and salty and crisp. </p><h2 class="">Duck</h2><p>Duck was also salted over night. Ended up rubbing with sumac, crushed brown cardamom, nutmeg, ground cloves, as well as rubbing with a meyer lemon and finishing with koji salt. </p><p>(image)</p><p>Put it in at 375 / door open. This is after 1hr or so?</p><p>(image)</p><p>I was juggling stuffing, Brussels sprouts, and roast veggies at this point and ran out of steam. I knew the breasts would overcook but didn’t have time to pause and so the duck breakdown. </p><p>I flipped it so the bottom would brown, which took another 45 minutes or so plus some light broil. </p><p>Took the duck apart to share with my parents. Legs and wings were great, breast was over cooked, but everything crispy salty delicious.</p><p>Spices didn’t come through that strongly, just some floral notes from the cardamom and lemony hints from the sumac. </p><p>Paused to package everything and share with parents. </p><p>I skipped lunch other than some cooked goose pieces so we had dinner at 4pm!</p><h2 class="">Goose Breast and actual Dinner</h2><p>I put a Tbsp of reserved goose fat in a pan and put the half goose breast in it. Pushed it down and kept moving around the pan. </p><p>Briefly seared meat side down — you can see how red it was. </p><p>(image)</p><p>(image)</p><p>I salted with koji salt and we sat down to eat. </p><p>This is definitely a top 5 meat that I’ve made. Extremely happy with how it turned out. Crisp and crackly skin layer, soft fat layer underneath, and light pink goose breast underneath. </p><p>(image)</p><p>Here’s the full plate.</p><ul><li>Spätzle noodles made by my mom</li><li>Brussels sprouts sautéed with smoked pork loin and garlic, finished with lemon juice, sherry vinegar, and a bit of maple syrup</li><li>Stuffing with goose giblets, onions, green leek tops, zest of a meyer lemon, dried apricots, diced celery, thyme, and a citrus panettone as the bread, plus goose fat</li><li>roasted sweet potatoes, celery, parsnips, fennel - done in goose fat with a bit of salt and a bit of maple syrup</li></ul><p>The sweet potatoes and parsnips were good. The celery, which I cut diagonally, ended up shriveling up. Rachael’s comment “I’m not eating dried up leaves”. </p><p>(image)</p><p>This is what was leftover AFTER Rachael and I ate. I snacked a bit later in the evening - ate the goose wing because it wouldn’t fit in the leftover container ;)</p><p>Oh yeah. Used a stick blender to blend the stock into gravy. Balanced with red wine, sherry, and some maple syrup. I usually make a flour and oil base and use stock and get a very think gravy. This was tasty as is but obviously a little thin. </p><p>First time using the big pan with the rack. Way more even and crisp poultry cooking. Cooking with the door open isn’t great. This is a half sheet, a quarter sheet would be fine for the duck and similarly sized chickens. </p><p>Duck and goose breast can be bought separately and are obviously way less complicated and messy. And my new Sous vide should come in handy with those too.</p></div>
