They are served with rice as an okazu (side dish), with drinks as an otsumami (snack), as an accompaniment to or garnish for meals, and as a course in the kaiseki portion of a Japanese tea ceremony.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Tsukemono are also referred to as konomono (香の物), oshinko (御新香) or okōkō (御香々), all carrying the meaning of "fragrant dish" in Japanese.[2] The ko or kō (香) portion in these names literally means "fragrant", and the term was used as a nyōbō kotoba or "woman's word" for miso in reference to the smell.[citation needed] Over time, this term was also applied to pickles, again for the smell. Oshinko (literally "new fragrance" in reference to relative freshness) more specifically referred to vegetables that had been only lightly pickled and that had not yet changed color that much.[citation needed] The term is now also used more broadly to refer to pickles in general.</p></blockquote><h2 class="">Making tsukemono </h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>To make tsukemono, one needs a container, salt, and something to apply downward pressure on top of the pickles.[2]</p><p>A tsukemonoki (漬物器) (literally "pickling container") is a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Japanese%2520pickle%2520press.html">Japanese pickle press</a>. The pressure is generated by heavy stones called tsukemono ishi (漬物石) (literally "pickle stone") with a weight of one to two kilograms, sometimes more. This type of pickle press is still in use, and can be made from a variety of materials, such as plastic, wood, glass or ceramic. Before tsukemono ishi came into use, the pressure was applied by driving a wedge between a handle of the container and its lid.[2]</p><p>The weights are either stone or metal, with a handle on top and often covered with a layer of food-neutral plastic. Another modern type of pickle press is usually made from plastic, and the necessary pressure is generated by turning a screw and clamping down onto the pickles.[2]</p><p>Asazuke is a pickling method characterized by its short preparation time.</p><p>Tsukemono Types[1]
