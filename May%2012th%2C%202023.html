<blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Khao soi or khao soy (Thai: ข้าวซอย, pronounced [kʰâ:w sɔ̄ːj]; Lao: ເຂົ້າຊອຍ [kʰȁw sɔ́ːj], Burmese: အုန်းနို့ခေါက်ဆွဲ ,pronounced [ʔóʊɴ no̰ kʰaʊʔ sʰwɛ́]) is a Chin Haw dish served in Laos and northern Thailand. A comparable dish, ohn no khao swè, is widely served in Myanmar. The name means 'cut rice', although it is possible that it is simply a corruption of the Burmese word for noodles – "khao swè" – which may account for the variations. Traditionally, the dough for the rice noodles is spread out on a cloth stretched over boiling water. After steaming the large sheet noodle is then rolled and cut with scissors. Lao khao soi is traditionally made with hand sliced rice noodles in clear soup broth and topped with minced pork.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khao_soi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khao_soi</a>

</span></p><p>Update: turns out it’s from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Fat%2520Mao.html">Fat Mao</a> - we love the Thai rice soup, the Thai egg salad, roti, and mapo tofu there. </p><p>In the late afternoon we ended up making the trek over to the first <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Shipyards%2520Night%2520Market.html">Shipyards Night Market</a> of the season — every Friday from 3pm - 10pm at the Shipyards next to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Lonsdale%2520Quay.html">Lonsdale Quay</a>.</p><p>We took a bus and then the Seabus, and it was a pretty glorious sunny afternoon. </p><p>The event was pretty mediocre. The food trucks are more like fair food (giant hot dogs and the funnel cake truck). There’s a big beer garden in front of the stage which will has music from 5pm. </p><p>We did get a big fresh squeezed lemonade from the lemonade truck.</p><p>We hadn’t been over there since they completed the new building. It’s got a giant open air covered space with seating around the edges, with shops and food. </p><p>We went to the new <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Jamjar.html">Jamjar</a> location. Got a chicken tawouk bowl and some halloumi fries. Both very tasty, the hummus and spinach dip with the bowl in particular were very good. A little pricey at $18 for the bowl in a set up that is more fast casual. </p><p>It was pretty loud and full (many kids on trikes and scooters in the covered area), so we wandered west to a little park overlooking Burrard inlet and just sat in the shade for a while. </p><p>Then we grabbed an Evo and went to Michael’s and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Real%2520Canadian%2520Superstore.html">Real Canadian Superstore</a>. It ended up being a pretty big shop as we thought about doing a picnic lunch in the park on Sunday. </p></div>
