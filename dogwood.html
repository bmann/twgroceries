Its habit varies based on the level of sunlight- in full sun it will have a short trunk with a crown as wide as it is tall, while under a canopy it will have a tapered trunk with a short, slender crown. [4]</p><p>The branches have fine hairs and the young bark is thin and smooth, becoming scale-like with ridges as it ages.[4]</p><p>The leaves are opposite, simple, oval, 5–12.7 centimetres (2.0–5.0 in) long, and 3.8–7.1 centimetres (1.5–2.8 in) broad. They are hairier on the bottom and have stiff, appressed hairs on top.[4]</p><p>The flowers are individually small and inconspicuous, 2–3 millimetres (0.079–0.118 in) across, produced in a dense, rounded, greenish-white flowerhead 2 centimetres (0.79 in)diameter; the 4-8 large white "petals" are actually bracts, each bract 4–7 centimetres (1.6–2.8 in) long and broad. The flowers commonly bloom twice per season, once in the spring and again in late summer or early fall.[4][3]</p><p>The fruit is a compound pink-red or orange drupe about 1–1.5 centimetres (0.39–0.59 in) long, in clusters containing 20-40 drupelets, each of which contains two seeds. They appear in September or October.[3][4]</p><h2 class="">Etymology</h2><p>Pacific Dogwood is similar in appearance to Cornus florida, the flowering dogwood, which is native to the eastern United States. When Scottish botanist David Douglas encountered Cornus nuttalli on his expedition to the Pacific Northwest in the 1820s, he mistook it for flowering dogwood and did not send seeds back to England.[3]</p><p>It was named nuttallii by John James Audubon after his friend Thomas Nuttall,[3] an English botanist who was the first to describe it for science while staying at Fort Vancouver in the autumn of 1834.[5]
