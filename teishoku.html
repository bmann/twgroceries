Thus in common speech, the drinking cup is referred to as yunomi-jawan or yunomi for the purpose of distinction. Among the nobility, each course of a full-course Japanese meal would be brought on serving napkins called zen (膳), which were originally platformed trays or small dining tables. In the modern age, faldstool trays or stackup-type legged trays may still be seen used in zashiki, i.e. tatami-mat rooms, for large banquets or at a ryokan type inn. Some restaurants might use the suffix -zen (膳) as a more sophisticated though dated synonym to the more familiar <strong>teishoku (定食)</strong>, since the latter basically is a term for a combo meal served at a taishū-shokudō, akin to a diner. <strong>Teishoku means a meal of fixed menu</strong> (for example, grilled fish with rice and soup), a dinner à prix fixe served at shokudō (食堂, "dining hall") or ryōriten (料理店, "restaurant"), which is somewhat vague (shokudō can mean a diner-type restaurant or a corporate lunch hall); writer on Japanese popular culture Ishikawa Hiroyoshi defines it as fare served at teishoku dining halls (定食食堂, teishoku-shokudō), and comparable diner-like establishments.
</p></blockquote><p>Depending on how you read it, this is "diner" combo meals, or even more pedestrian corporate cafeteria food, although more broadly it seems to mean a set menu.</p><p>The <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://kome-academy.com/en/corp/index.html#corp03" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plenus "kome" academy</a> is "research into Japan's rice culture" and has several sub sections, including <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://kome-academy.com/en/teishoku_library/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teishoku library</a>:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Teishoku, or a set menu, is a regular feature in Japanese restaurants. Each menu often starts with a side dish such as "Deep-fried Pork Teishoku". Teishoku has a typical serving style that reflects what Japanese people eat on a day to day basis, and consists of rice, soup, pickles and main dishes with meat, fish and vegetables.</p><p>Even though main dishes headline the menu, rice plays the central role in Teishoku. Japanese people have been eating rice since early times. Rice is a unique ingredient that goes with any kind of dish. In Teishoku, all other dishes surround a rice bowl and they are planned and cooked in a way to enhance their flavors when eaten with rice. Regardless of the accompanying side dishes, rice completes the style of Teishoku.</p><p>Another feature of Teishoku is that all dishes are put on the table at the same time. It may seem strange from a western eating style, but it is a characteristic of Japanese food culture. Teishoku, deeply rooted in Japanese everyday life, offers healthy nutritional balance, aesthetics to please one’s five senses, chef's spirituality and more. Japanese comfort food Teishoku fulfills not only our bodies but minds, too. It also has a strong relationship with the historical evolution of Japanese food culture.</p><p>In Teishoku reside many features of Japanese food that have been drawing attention throughout the world. Our Teishoku Library explores the beauty of Teishoku.
