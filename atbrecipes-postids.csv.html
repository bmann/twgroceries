This was 2 oranges and 2 peeled and cored quinces and un-measured sugar. 

Next time just juice the oranges — they don’t really melt into the sugar. 

Ended up with 350ml of sugary juice syrup, and added just 50ml of white wine vinegar. We’re finding the vinegar sort of obliterates the fruit in 1:1 or even 1/2:1 ratios — so how about 1/7:1. Very much to taste and I’m sure different fruits would have different flavours. Quince in this form is pretty delicate and flowery.

There is a lot of great recipe and cooking video content on Instagram Stories, but much like everything else from Facebook, it’s hard to get to and link to from the rest of the web. 

And, they disappear! You can pin them in highlights, which do have links, but this still isn’t great for someone attempting to follow the recipe. 

Right now it’s a multi step process. Using apps to combine multiple videos (assuming either re-using videos from Instagram stories or recording locally on your phone), then saving the combined videos on your phone, then uploading it to YouTube, then copying the link to embed it here, where you can add links and photos.

I added a photo below of the pork in progress. Attaching / uploading videos here is pretty simple. 

Ideally, skipping the YouTube step means you could attach video here directly, but that will take some research.  

I hardly ever create video content, but I was inspired by Grace Lee, who you can find on Instagram:

https://instagram.com/EikCamCeramics

Grace has been doing an amazing job of posting recipes to her Instagram stories, so I’ve been talking to her about saving those videos. 

Other than this test here on the forum, what’s the best food blog platform that supports video?

## iMovie on iPhone

https://youtu.be/k4j1RLL0J8M

Glueing videos together works fine. The app is super minimal. Doesn’t support vertical video as far as I could tell. 

Complicated to overlay multiple items — you need to split clips at all the spots you want to overlay text. 

## InShot on iPhone 

https://youtu.be/8wUgFoJlaXw

Rich editing. Stickers, emoji, text. Overlay multiple things. Can change the ratio to many different kinds. Super simple to stretch how things get overlaid. 

Free version has the watermark and ads. Pro version is $20/year which seems totally reasonable. 

## Vimeo Create

This was very clean and simple (had the best / easiest option for selecting vertical video), but did all the glueing together on the server, and then the Pro version is $30/month.

---

I uploaded both videos, which I saved back to my phone’s camera roll, using the YouTube app.

Here in the forum, copy and pasting a link to the YouTube share link will embed the video.

## Leftovers Lunch

The tiny little part in the middle of this one minute video is me showing you some leftovers. So here are the notes on making them.

### Pork, Dill, and Lemon Rice Stuffing

The pork, dill, rice, lemon mixture started out as a stuffing for red bell peppers. I sautéed some onions and garlic and the minced stems from the dill in some oil, plus a little fresh ground coriander seeds, then added the ground pork. 

![image|666x500](upload://klCto143RppIXxBUng0hllnCemB.jpeg) 

I drained the pork of a lot of the fat that cooked out, and kept it to bake the peppers in. Added salt and pepper to taste. 

Separately I cooked some basmati rice, mixed it with the pork mixture, chopped up the rest of the fresh dill bunch, grated the zest from a lemon in using a micro plane, and then squeezed the juice from the lemon in. 

---

Rice is always a wonderful leftover, and pork and fresh dill is even better. After heating it, I did add a couple of spoonfuls of the kimchi that’s on the counter. Little bit of acid, little bit of funk, and some nice spice.

### Duck Soup with Orzo

The Choices on Commercial Drive very often has fresh whole duck for $20-$25. I bought some and of course made stock from the bones and leftovers.

I made a quick soup by adding in some diced carrots and celery, salt and pepper, and brought it up to a boil. I added in a handful of orzo. 

For finishing and balance, I’ll often add a splash of apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar.</td><td>2020-03-23 19:28:21 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>870</td><td>Forage Vancouver</td><td>Brunch, corned bison hash:

On Saturday, I pulled a couple of frozen lamb shanks from Legends Haul out of the freezer, diced a large onion, and stuck it in the cast iron pan that had breakfast bacon grease in it. Adds some salt and pepper and a little olive oil on top and broiled it until starting to brown on both sides. 

In an oven proof pot, I had rainbow carrots and chopped up half a head of green cabbage that needed using up.

Come to think of it, all of those ingredients were from Legends Haul. 

A dried out Spanish chorizo? Sure, slice it up and put it in as well. Plus a little bit of minced ginger, and a liberal splash of apple cider vinegar. 

Added the lamb shanks and onions into the pot and covered. Let it cook for 3-4 hours at 350, covered, adding a little more apple cider vinegar and salt. 

The lamb fell off the bone, and the cabbage was sour and meaty plus the sweetness of carrots and the spicy surprise of chunks of chorizo.

Rachael took off their heads and I peeled the rest of them. I made two sauces for them, to be used raw and to baste on the BBQ. 

One was cilantro, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, fresh jalapeño, and maple syrup and was the fan favourite. 

The other was cilantro, ginger, [Pho Japoli chili oil](https://allthebest.recipes/t/pho-japolo-family-run-vietnamese/389), toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce. This was initially too spicy, so I added sweetness and mellowed it out with ketchup.

![image|357x500](upload://6Bkc9fyWd1vQ12JV5hLtLP6vH7B.jpeg) 

This recipe is pretty easy to mix up with different spices:

* 1 1/2 pounds fish fillets (e.g., haddock, cod, catfish, pollock, or similar mild white fish)
* Kosher salt, to taste
* Pepper, to taste
* 1 cup panko breadcrumbs (unseasoned)
* 2 tablespoons parsley (finely chopped)
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs (or 1/2 cup egg substitute)
* 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning (or Creole)
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 lemon
* Optional: tartar sauce or rémoulade sauce (for serving)

Instead of parsley, used dried dill mixed with the panko.

Rather than Cajun seasoning, I used a lemon herb spice mix. 

![image|690x409](upload://wajjPpqmaJ7NAL6kxEQv4FtUwZl.jpeg) 

I like how this turned out. The hake was very soft and neutral. I cooked it for 16 minutes and then on low broil for another couple of minutes to fully crisp and brown the top. 

The bottom ended up soft. I think flipping it half way through cooking would crisp up.

Needed a bit more salt, probably in the egg dip. Which could have had more lemon herb spices too ;)</td><td>2020-05-17 03:05:55 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>576</td><td>Trans Am Restaurant - Burgers, Cocktails, and No Phones in Hastings Sunrise</td><td>https://www.transamrestaurant.com/

Definitely getting the fermentation. Drinking the part that doesn’t fit in the bottles we have right after filtering, strong pineapple taste, some tartness from the rhubarb, but no rhubarb flavour. Maybe a slight edge from the lemon but pretty subtle. 

Drinking it now after aging, it’s gotten to be fairly Radler flavoured. A nice smell of sweet / pineapple, with a mineral / nail polish finish. Not sweet at all, to the point where Rachael says it smells like beer. 

If I want a rhubarb flavour, going to need a lot more rhubarb. And, it may just be better to add the rhubarb syrup after fermenting if I want that flavour and colour. 

This was just one pineapple skin and core, so nice to see that I can make 3-4 litres in 3-4 days.</td><td>2020-06-16 20:04:03 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>641</td><td>Little Bavaria Restaurant in Port Alberni</td><td>http://www.littlebavariarestaurant.com/

We spent 3.5 hours walking the show and were pretty dead on our feet after that. We headed to Elm Coffee that @expede had introduced me to: 

https://community.frontierfoundry.co/t/elm-coffee-roasters/284

They were closing pretty soon so we didn’t have long to sit and relax. I had a macchiato and Rachael had some sort of tea blend that included carrots. 

![image|375x500](upload://ct5q0cyBwGwzKHeAXdhWJcSJLaM.jpeg) 

What was really outstanding was a stellar sweet empanada — there were several kinds, we got the guava &amp; cream cheese. 

I’m a sucker for guava plus this has really good pastry. 

Next Rachael had a store in Japantown she wanted to visit.

## Snappy Dragon

By this time we were getting hungry for dinner and so decided to go back to Snappy Dragon. I had found it just by searching the area on the way out of town on a previous trip. It’s a cheap and cheerful Chinese place with massive portions.

### Mushu Chicken with Pancakes

Stir fry of mushrooms, veggies, and green onions, with your choice of pork, chicken, tofu, or shrimp. And a giant saucer of hoisin. 

You rip up the pancake and put some hoisin on and pile on the mushu. Like a little taco. 

Somewhat plain in flavour, but tasty and I liked the ritual of making little pancake bites.

### Ants Climb a Tree

We had this as medium spicy, 3 out of 5, and it was only a little spicy, but extremely garlicky. 

These are glass noodles mixed with spicy ground pork with chillies and garlic. Very much Szechuan flavours although I didn’t taste the numbing burn of Szechuan peppercorns. 

Very tasty, would have it again!

I made some quick pickled beets. I say quick, because I just cook them with vinegar and sugar and spices and haven’t looked up a recipe ;)

I peeled the beets and cut them into 1/2cm slices. 

Added 2 cloves garlic, sliced. 

2 Tbsp of dill seeds

1 Tbsp of salt

3 Tbsp of sugar

1 tsp chilli flakes

1 cup of white vinegar

Then covered with water and simmered until soft but still with crunch. I let them cool, transferred to a jar to store in the fridge with the liquid and spices, and topped up with half water, half rice vinegar.</td><td>2020-05-04 04:36:39 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>647</td><td>Moltaqa Moroccan Restaurant</td><td>Went here yesterday with my mom for lunch. One thing I forgot is that Moroccan cuisine has a lot of cilantro in it. And my mom has the “cilantro tastes like soap” gene :smile:

There is a lovely seat in the window that gets full sun, which was great on a cold winter day. I was waiting for my mom to meet me so ordered som Moroccan traditional mint tea. It is sweet but not overly sweetened as I’ve had served elsewhere. 

![image|666x500](upload://jZN6vk0D9naegX6ZkYle2Qku5I.jpeg) 

The restaurant is changing up the menu, plus I had to order around the cilantro. They ended up bringing my mom her own lentil stew since the eggplant one I ordered DID have cilantro in it. 

The stews come with fresh baked rounds of bread plus olive oil.

You can order just the lunch plate and be totally full, or you can order various sides and share plates to get a taste of everything. 

The kofte (which they have listed outside as “meatball plate” because this isn’t that common in Vancouver) are made of beef and really nicely spiced. 

Apparently they’re taking their merguez sausage off the menu and will be doing kofte. 

Not pictured, a side of harissa hot sauce. It’s only medium spicy and tastes strongly of preserved lemons.

I got a whole coho from [Skipper Otto]() and went over to Bowen for the weekend. 

Did some research:

* My Easy Cooking https://www.my-easy-cooking.com/2018/12/14/whole-salmon-baked-in-salt/

That second link adds egg whites to coarse salt and makes a kind of meringue to cover the fish in. 

I was already kind of winging it without a sheet of the right size, so no meringue for me. 

I gathered fresh rosemary and oregano from the garden and put some of that in the salt mixture. 

![image|666x500](upload://rBBsTczj5bURAgNCm8PpbUEml93.jpeg) 

Made a bed of salt and layered it with onions, lemons, and oregano sprigs.

![image|666x500](upload://A7CwluwYmgXF0rWYG1MPBJUHyZq.jpeg) 

Put the salmon on top. Stuffed the cavity with onions and rosemary. Layered lemon and onion and oregano on top. 

![image|666x500](upload://rsURcD4l6f306ckeVdkWDAEJCvi.jpeg) 

Yeah, this salmon is too big for this roaster. Need a big flat sheet. My apartment oven at home wouldn’t be big enough at all. 

![image|666x500](upload://5TvdvSZjulq0yHJpE6UxKtJP8kT.jpeg) 

I ended up opening another container of salt to really probably cover the fish. 

Now into a preheated oven at 400F/204C.

Out after 50 minutes. The oregano is darkened and the tail is crispy and done. 

![image|666x500](upload://25HTQxsBU1wgiP5yaZTd3jpvkny.jpeg) 

The salt had hardened into an outer crust that I had to break through and push aside. 

![image|666x500](upload://itR39IvCGMQzVVeTySfPJgz9WTf.jpeg) 

Cut through the top and lifted off the bones. So nice to work with a whole fish. It was a little bit underdone — you can see how dark red it still is. I put it back in the hot oven for 5 minutes and it was perfect. 

![image|666x500](upload://3KIl7pZgOQwTyPxW5K22eBv5Izz.jpeg) 

The salmon was juicy and delicious. The occasional piece of skin had salt on it, but the fish itself wasn’t salty. The oregano flavour lightly flavoured the fish in a nice way. 

Served with rice, steamed veggies, and sautéed kohlrabi with a white sauce.

It grows wild in eastern and western North America but is considered an introduced species. It is also cultivated widely across the temperate zone for its tuber, which is used as a root vegetable

## Roasted Sunchokes

https://www.abeautifulplate.com/roasted-sunchokes/

&gt; Sunchokes can be served raw, roasted, fried, pureed into soups, or steamed. Similarly to celery root, sunchokes will oxidize when sliced, so it’s best to use them right away or store them in acidulated water (water with the juice of one lemon) if not using immediately.</td><td>2020-04-26 05:31:58 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>733</td><td>Potato Salad and Pulled Pork in the Park</td><td>Pulled pork is very high in the delicious to easy-ness ratio. I had a pork butt that came in my last order from Bruce &amp; Clarke, added Monsoon Coast BBQ Rub all over it, and put it in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours.

![image|375x500](upload://cq6OiKKLjQtMKLJQaWflO6fVf0T.jpeg) 

Cooking it at 300F in the oven on an aluminum foil wrapped tray is the other way to do it which gets you a hard bark on the outside. 

The slow cooker version is easier, also much wetter and fattier.

You should be able to pull apart the meat with a couple of forks right in slow cooker. I added salt, a couple of Tbsp of dijon mustard, and a Tbsp or so of apple cider vinegar. 

I portioned the pulled pork into various containers and froze a lot of it — tacos, pasta, potatoes, rice, at breakfast with some scrambled eggs — your pulled pork can go with anything ;)

![image|500x500](upload://zPZU8sCVibqaTEyosC3EFSO5ntV.jpeg) 

This is pretty much my regular German-style potato salad, which means no mayo, and often some bacon. Without meat, it’s actually vegan ;)

In this case, I’m still working my way through a guanciale from Legends Haul. I cut a couple of slices of guanciale into small cubes and put it in a pan in the oven until crispy and the fat had rendered out. 

This is just 1 potato, since Bruce &amp; Clarke sent me 5 lbs of potatoes in the form of... 5 potatoes! They are a tasty yellow flesh potato which I like for my potato salad. 

A bunch of radishes, cut into fine cubes, and 1.5 large dill pickles finely cubed. 

1/3 cup of chopped fresh parsley. 

Dressing is 1-2 Tbsp of Dijon mustard, 1-2 Tbsp of pickle juice, 1 Tbsp of olive oil, 1 Tbsp of guanciale fat, and juice from 1 fresh lemon. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Also in that picture are some roasted radishes. Even done in some guanciale fat and sprinkled with koji salt, they’re just OK.

Plus added some lemony pickled cabbage and a little of the liquid brine for salt, acid, and citrus flavours. 

Not pictured on the plate, I made a brussel sprouts slaw with sliced apple, some minced apricots, a handful of minced radishes, juice from 2 fresh lemons, a little date vinegar, and some maple syrup.

![Hand holding red kuri squash](upload://tvhtPp2VJEdqUR5B2OWIeRIksvM.jpeg)

This particular one was bought at Choices on Commercial Drive in Vancouver, and is grown in Mexico.

Interesting facts about this [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kuri_squash):

&gt; It is generally believed that all squash originated in Mesoamerica, but may have been independently cultivated elsewhere, albeit later.
&gt;
&gt;Red kuri squash is commonly called "Japanese squash", "orange Hokkaido squash", "baby red hubbard squash", or "Uchiki kuri squash". In Japan, the word  *kuri*  may refer to either the squash discussed in this article or to Japanese chestnuts. In France, it is called  *potimarron* , and in the United Kingdom, it is commonly called "onion squash".
&gt;
&gt;Primarily grown in Japan, California, Florida, Southwestern Colorado, Mexico, Tasmania, Tonga, New Zealand, Chile, Provence, and South Africa, red kuri is widely adapted for climates that provide a growing season of 100 days or more. Most of the California, Colorado, Tonga and New Zealand crops are exported to Japan.</td><td>2020-04-06 17:52:46 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>570</td><td>Szechuan Peppercorn in Vancouver</td><td>I bought some at [Famous Foods](/t/famous-foods-vancouvers-original-natural-and-bulk-food-store/299) but they were brown and dry and hardly any flavour.

[Bagna Cauda (Wikipedia)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagna_càuda)

Kind of like fondue, it’s a garlic anchovy dip served with a variety of crisp raw veggies plus some cooked purple potatoes and roasted sunchokes, and a few hunks of bread.

The only other place in Vancouver we’ve had this was the [[Mackenzie Room]], as a “reverse” Bagna Cauda — cold whipped garlic / anchovies with roasted veggies. 

This is our must order dish here ;)

&gt; Even though hake is plentiful in our waters, and we actually fish more hake on the BC coast than we do all five species of salmon (!), it is almost entirely exported to Europe and Asia. That's why we're so excited to have met Cary Williams, an independent hake fisherman from Sointula.

&gt; We'll have some recipes from Ned Bell for you as soon as he can, but we recommend poaching this fish in a tomato-y broth, adding it to stews or curries, or battering it for some yummy fish n' chips. It's a delicate, very mild fish

From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hake):

&gt; Hake is in the same taxonomic order ([Gadiformes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadiformes)) as [cod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod) and [haddock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddock). It is a medium-to-large fish averaging from 1 to 8 pounds (0.45 to 3.63 kg) in weight, with specimens as large as 60 pounds (27 kg).

Further in the Wikipedia article, it looks like Spain consumes half of the hake in Europe. Since it’s in the cod family, it ends up as fish &amp; chips in the UK.

The Skipper Otto [introduction and interview with fishermen Cary Williams has more details](https://skipperotto.com/welcome-cary-hake/) on why there is no local market in BC:

&gt; Almost 100% of the hake caught in BC is exported to foreign markets. And the BC catch is huge. We catch more hake in BC than all the salmon put together! But there is no local market for it. Why? Who knows. A combination of cultural traditions and global supply chains, most likely. The hake industry has been consolidated into the hands of just a few large export-oriented operations: 7 factory vessels that are at sea for months at a time in BC waters, catching, heading, gutting, freezing, and boxing at sea before shipping straight to markets in Russia, Europe, and Asia. The largest markets for hake are in Russia and the Ukraine where hake is a much-loved delicate, mild, white fish.

From the article, here’s a picture of some hake:

Taro on Wikipedia:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro

This [Serious Eats article](https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/10/seriously-asian-taro-root.html) finds that in the US it’s seen as an Asian ingredient:

&gt; Much of the world's population eats taro in one way or another, so there's nothing inherently  *Asian*  about this week's ingredient. But here in the U.S., more likely than not, we find taro in an Asian preparation because we don't always have wide access to African cookery or those of the Oceanic and South American cultures that also use the root. 
&gt;
&gt;**There are many varieties of taro,**  the root of a perennial plant with large, elephantine leaves. Some are small, round, and hairy, like rodents, others are larger and elongated, like daikon. Inside, the flesh ranges pure white to ivory with streaks of pale purple.

Some research finds a handful of recipes.

From [Cook's Country](https://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/6922-english-muffin-bread) magazine, we got it from Lee &amp; Sachi on Orcas Island. 

[Leite's Culinaria has the full recipe](https://leitesculinaria.com/97133/recipes-english-muffin-bread.html) that I've posted here:

* Butter, for the pans and plastic wrap
* Cornmeal, for the pans
* 5 cups (27 1/2 ounces) bread flour
* 4 1/2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 3 cups whole milk, heated to 120°F (49°C)

_Note:_

Note that this English muffin bread recipe calls for bread flour and not all-purpose flour. And don’t even think about swapping all-purpose flour for bread flour or your English muffin bread will be a flop to the magnitude of a Bridget Jones-worthy kitchen flop. And keep in mind that bread flour absorbs more water than all-purpose flour, which means it turns into a wet, sticky dough that resembles pancake batter. Don’t freak. It’s supposed to be a lot runnier and goopier than typical American bread dough. Just take a breath and hang with our recipe instructions.

Substituted instant yeast for active yeast. Reading up on that, active needs to be activated in liquid, while instant can just go in dry ingredients. I still put the instant in lukewarm water with honey to start. 

We have a big Rubbermaid container with lid that I used instead of a bowl. I put the lid on loosely and put it in the fridge overnight. 

The next morning it had doubled nicely and filled the container. As recommended I used a couple of forks to fold the dough over itself with olive oil, then poured it into a buttered pan.

The pan I used was bigger than a 9x13 pan with sort of a half height rim. Here it is after a 3 hour rise, nicely filling the pan.

This vaguely a curry in that I used some curry techniques like toasting spices in oil. Brown mustard seed in particular. No particular cuisine this is based on. 

In the back of my mind, I considered adding either chicken bouillon or miso paste, but there was a good depth of flavour and enough salt. 

Putting the crushed chilies in the oil right at the beginning meant that the spice went everywhere. Have to be careful with quantities, or add a chili paste later in the cooking to taste.

At Dosanko, you can get the dish with a vegetarian tomato sauce, or Hayashi sauce (beef) or Curry sauce (pork), on top of a relatively plain rice. And the omelette is lovely and soft on the inside. At table side the outer egg is cut open to reveal the still soft egg on the inside, and the sauce is poured over top. 

When looking up recipes, I saw them done differently — as chicken fried rice filled inside the omelette.

Here’s two versions I found:

https://www.justonecookbook.com/omurice-japanese-omelette-rice/

https://norecipes.com/omurice-recipe/

So let’s call this the Dosanko version of Omurice. 

I sautéed 1 1/2 cups of rice in a tablespoon of ghee with a couple of tsp of salt until it browned. Then 3 cups water and cook for 20 minutes. 

The tomato sauce started with a half a small onion finely chopped and sautéed in olive oil. Added a Tablespoon of butter, and salt and pepper. Two cups of quartered Campari tomatoes put in on high heat. Added a 1/2 Tbsp of tomato paste and a tsp of sugar.

For the omelette I started with a Tablespoon of butter and 1/2 Tbsp of canola oil. 5 eggs, a Tbsp of Half and Half cream, and a bit of salt. 

I didn’t get the whole thing as soft as the Dosanko version (I’m not sure how to fold it over properly), but it was still soft and able to be folded back. Here are the omelettes on the rice, folded open. 

![image|375x500](upload://nkIE4teow0ZmCSvFsgIOCmZzlxj.jpeg) 

No pictures of the final version, but I’m happy with how it came together. The sweetness and acidity of the tomato sauce, the butter smoothness of the omelette, and the nutty flavour of the sautéed rice worked well.</td><td>2019-12-03 03:53:00 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>600</td><td>Christmas Orange Goose, Chestnut Stuffing, and Sides</td><td> This will be the run down of tonight’s Christmas meal.

&gt; Established in 2003, The Farm House Natural Cheeses produces handmade artisan cheeses and specialties from the rich, fresh whole milk of the farm’s own dairy cows and goats. Everything is made right on our farm in British Columbia’s beautiful Fraser Valley. In our on-farm cheese shop you can sample and purchase all of the different varieties of cheeses as well as our traditional Greek style yogurt &amp; bottled cows and goats milk is also a treat. The milk is delivered directly from the dairy to the cheese room daily, where you can look in on the cheese-making process. Make sure you treat yourself to an Italian-style gelati ice cream. Back in our shop, we have a great selection of locally based artisan products such as jams, teas, gluten-free crackers, honey and much more.
&gt;
&gt;Our cheese and milk products are available at various retail locations in Vancouver and across BC as well as Farmers Markets in the Lower Mainland. In addition, our cheeses are featured at a number of restaurants in BC and beyond.</td><td>2020-12-14 08:24:45 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>775</td><td>Okinawan Sweet Potato</td><td>![image|500x500](upload://ojJo3gm20J7pTGimed4rwwhGQje.jpeg) 

Got this from [Exotic Orchard](https://allthebest.recipes/t/exotic-orchard-produce-grocery-delivery/410/3) — had never heard of it before. 

It’s apparently common also in Hawaii:

&gt; The Okinawan sweet potato is not related to the potato but is actually in the morning glory family. Native to the Americas, it was brought to Japan sometime between 1492 and 1605. The hardy plant grew well in Japan and quickly became popular in a variety of Japanese dishes. When it eventually made its way to the Hawaiian Islands, brought by the Polynesians, the crop flourished in the rich volcanic soil.
&gt; https://www.downtoearth.org/health/nutrition/okinawan-sweet-potato-purple-powerhouse-nutrition

I cooked this a bit like the [simmered taro root](https://allthebest.recipes/t/taro-root-eddoe-malanga-madumbi-dasheen/400). Cut it into 1cm slices, added some water but not to cover, stirred in 1 Tbsp of shiro miso, and simmered until soft. Added a splash of mirin to finish. When cooked, the whole inside turns dark purple.

![image|500x500](upload://sT6D9zIV5b3JEZqkYdZlLnBXd62.jpeg) 

Sweeter, softer, and without the chalky texture of the taro root.

Just did a little more searching and found this Spruce Eats article with more info and some recipes:

&gt; Sweet potatoes are grown underground while yams grow on a vine above the ground, though yams do look like a tuber. The two are commonly confused and mislabeled at the market, so most people in the U.S. have never eaten an actual yam (native to Africa). There are purple varieties of both vegetables. The purple yam is the Filipino  *ube*  or  *ubi* , and it is very rare to find it in the United States. It has a darker, rougher-looking skin that's brown and reminiscent of tree bark. This vegetable is a major crop and food source in the Philippines. It is also made into a powder, which is then used in Filipino desserts that are unmistakable with their bright purple color.

We juiced oranges until we had 1 cup of juice (about 4-5 oranges) and then added 1 cup of organic sugar and stirred until it was blended in.

All usually start with a hot 400/450 oven, and then reduce to 300/325, and again finish with high heat.

Close to the IKEA, this Armenian bakery does wholesale but also has a little cafe with table service and outdoor seating. 

The most “famous” thing on the menu is the fresh out of the oven bread boat — filled with cheese and egg and optionally cured meat.

It’s a pretty great “fancy” Thai place that has a wide range of dishes, especially lots of appetizers. 

We ordered “cho ladda”, or floral dumplings:

![image|666x500](upload://uDLp4KqhzrlNZysZIulBA13Ex8l.jpeg) 

They’re beautiful to look at steamed dumplings filled with ground meat and palm sugar and some floral notes. 

I did a search for _cho ladda_ and didn’t really find anything. 

I did find them called _chor muang_, or Thai royal steamed dumplings, in this recipe:

https://jackiem.com.au/2015/09/22/how-to-make-chor-muang-thai-royal-steamed-dumplings/

&gt; One of three rare Thai dishes traditionally served to the Thai royal family,  **Chor Muang**  is a steamed dumpling delicately formed into flowers using a pair of tweezers with serrated tips. The  **purple colour**  is obtained from the petals of what we call  **bunga telang**  in Malaysia; though you can achieve the same effect with food colouring.

Here’s another video on making these dumplings, at Patara in London:

These dumplings are delicious. We only had a few dishes, so decided to have another order for dessert ;)</td><td>2020-02-22 17:24:37 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>628</td><td>Broken Down Duck with Olives and Tomatoes</td><td>Choices on The Drive often has fresh whole duck in their meat department. Today, it was half the price of some very nice looking but pricy organic chickens. 

I broke down the duck into legs, breasts, and wings, plus a pile of skin / duck fat and leftover carcass. 

(Yes, breaking down poultry is extremely satisfying)

https://twitter.com/arachnocapital2/status/1229641939110088705

The carcass and neck and some of the fat I put in the oven on broil you roast and crisp up. It went into the slow cooker with bits and pieces of the veggies I prepped, including the stem of a cabbage. 

![image|690x477](upload://kvkiN5Z7DkD6xXAPsMCy34N34E7.jpeg) 

A large onion is sliced underneath and I halved about a 1/4 cup of stuffed olives. Salt, pepper, thyme, and paprika are the seasonings. 

I started by broiling until the skin crisped up and then roasted at 385F for about an hour. I took the duck out and added three large chopped Roma tomatoes. 

![image|666x500](upload://2y4B7YkeyBiqITHicDiA5M1GDEU.jpeg) 

This went back in for 30 minutes and then finished with 15min on a low broil, with some mixing in as the tomatoes and juices started to blend together. 

Any duck skin that isn’t directly under the broiler doesn’t get crisp, but I knew this was going to be different. More of a way to make chicken than duck. It was tasty, and we only ate the two legs — lots left. No final pics, and also not pictured, some veggies. 

I bought a really nice kabota squash, quartered it, scooped the inside out, and sliced it. Tossed with olive oil, salt &amp; pepper, and chopped some fresh cilantro that needed using up. Put it on the stovetop with the lid on and started on medium and then gradually reduced the heat, tossing it regularly. Cooked in its own moisture and the olive oil and was nice and sweet.

A green cabbage also needed using. R doesn’t like cooked cabbage at all, but I do. 

I can’t find the source recipe that originally inspired me to do cabbage + mustard, but it’s basically a white sauce with Dijon mustard added. 

Tonight, I kept it even simpler. Chopped the cabbage into big wedges and stuff it into a small sauce pan. Added 1.5Tbsp of Dijon mustard plus a little salt and maybe 2-3 Tbsp of water. Kept the lid on, worked the water and mustard throughout, and it steamed nicely. 

Served with leftover Egyptian rice.</td><td>2020-02-18 07:12:28 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>677</td><td>Peppery Tomato Vegetable Soup</td><td>![image|375x500](upload://qPd6jQiJ2G4Fzdr1iyvvcKcTvTR.jpeg) 

Do I need to log every little lunch time creation? Maybe!

I made a roast chicken last night and put the bones and carcass in the Crockpot to make stock overnight. I cleaned out my frozen veggie bits — onion tops, cilantro bottoms, etc. And added a couple of carrots and a knob of ginger. 

Today I strained it into a pot and added two carrots, a small onion, and 3 or 4 brown mushrooms, all diced. 

Brought it up to a boil and then simmered on high for about 45 minutes until it reduced. 

Added a Tablespoon of tomato paste (we use tubes of paste so it’s easy to add to dishes), a splash of apple cider vinegar. Lots of fresh ground black pepper and salt to taste. 

Added ~1/2 cup of orzo and boiled for about 7 minutes. 

Tasty!

https://www.instagram.com/p/B_dNPtfhULS/

He replied to my plea with some basics:

&gt; Go commando. Here’s a rough guide: a whack of fresh grated ginger, the skin of one or two pineapples, sugar to taste (maybe a cup or two? To taste!), a few star anise, a few pods of cardamom, water (let sit overnight to de-chlorinate). All goes in a mega-Mason jar (Famous Foods sells them). Ferment for 2-3 days. Transfer to pop-top glass bottles for secondary fermentation. Burp every couple of hours. Put in fridge. DM me if you need more info! It’s really a loosey-goosey recipe

But first, what is tepache? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepache) tells us it's a fermented pineapple beverage:

&gt; Tepache is a fermented beverage made from the peel and the rind of pineapples, and is sweetened either with piloncillo or brown sugar, seasoned with powdered cinnamon, and served cold. Though tepache is fermented for several days, the resulting drink does not contain much alcohol. In Mexican culinary practice, the alcoholic content of tepache may be increased with a small amount of beer.
&gt;
&gt; In Mexico, tepache is usually sold as a chilled drink by street vendors. It is usually stored in barrels to make the fermentation process faster. It is served either in a clay mug or in a clear plastic bag with a straw inserted for easier travel. In the U.S., it is sold in juice bars or traditional Mexican restaurants in the Mexican American communities of the Southwestern United States. The fermentation process for making tepache is simple and quick, which makes tepache a drink readily produced at home.

OK, great! Even better, Fernando sent me some step by step pictures:

Those bottles with the ceramic flip tops? Turns out Fernando and I get them from the same source -- find a store near you that sells fancy lemonade or spritzer that comes in the bottles, wash them out, and re-use them for whatever you need. Ikea has ones with crappier lids on them, and honestly buying fancy drinks is probably the cheapest way to get your hands on them.

I have some tamarind paste around that I don’t experiment with enough, and sounds very savoury as the weather gets colder.

&gt; Made these "layered yogurt flatbreads" (aka: parathas) yesterday, and they are VERY GOOD.
&gt;
&gt;Note that the recipe calls for adding yogurt + 2 tbsp of water to the bowl. I only added 1 tbsp of water and my dough was so sticky I had to add a bunch more flour. I recommend adding just the yogurt to the flour/salt/bp and then see how it feels when you start to knead it. You might still need to add flour at that point. It depends on how wet your yogurt is.

&gt;I'm sure you could easily veganize it by using a plant-based yogurt &amp; olive oil instead of yogurt &amp; butter.

## Trinidadian Chicken Curry

I had 4 chicken thighs and 2 full legs that I skinned. Removed the bones from the thighs and cut apart the legs to leave the drum sticks, and cubed the thigh meet.

I marinated them in the green seasoning with 2 Tbsp of Dijon mustard plus a little salt and black pepper.

I put the chicken skin and trimmed fat in the oven at 300F to render the fat. I used that fat and a little coconut ghee to toast 3 Tbsp of the Trinidadian curry powder. Let toast and foam a bit, then added half a minced onion and kept sautéing on high. Added the chicken meat with the marinade. 

Add 3/4 of a cup of water and put in the oven at 300F. 

![image|666x500](upload://yoj5IqkfpNHl5ep6dTk13zBImm5.jpeg) 

## Lamb Mango Coconut Curry

This was pretty much entirely made up. 

I had three boneless lamb steaks and a bit of pork belly. I trimmed the fat from them and put the fat in the oven to render. Cubed the meet into 1 inch cubes.

I grated 3 cloves of garlic and a 2 inch knob of garlic on a micro plane and stirred into the meat cubes, plus coarse salt and pepper. Chopped up 3 Tbsp of cilantro stalks. Chopped up half a giant red mango and added into the meat mixture (probably a whole regular mango). This sat and marinated for about an hour. 

In the lamb/pork fat I sautéed two minced red Thai chilies, a tsp of fennel seeds, 2 tsp of mustard seeds, and half a chopped onion. Waited for onion to brown then added meat mixture and two celery stalks, small 1/2 cm cubes. 

Kept heat on high and kept stirring the meat until it was starting to brown. Added a can of coconut milk. 

Put in oven for 3 hours on 300F. Near the end, added other half of giant mango and half a chopped red pepper. 

This was sweet from the coconut and mango, and had a low and slow background burn from the Thai red chiles.

## Side Dishes

I made two salads as side dishes. 

I was inspired by Barbadian Pickled Cucumbers:

https://tastetheislandstv.com/barbadian-pickled-cucumber/

I sliced the cucumbers very thin and added juice from one fresh lime, and chopped up some cilantro. I added a Tbsp of sugar and put it in the fridge to marinate. 

The second salad was diced cucumbers, a Tbsp of minced red onion, half a diced pineapple, chopped cilantro, salt, and juice from a fresh lime. 

This wasn’t very interesting in flavour when it came out, so I added a tsp of powdered garlic, some rice wine vinegar, and a little more salt. The garlic worked really well — wish this had gone in as raw garlic for the marinade. And it could have had hot peppers in it for a little kick. Still, the sweet pineapples in there went really well with everything else.

It turns out bread pudding is incredibly simple! 

I used skim milk powder to make the cup of milk and only put in about half a cup of maple syrup, and added 2 Tbsp cane sugar. 

I also had a soft banana in the freezer that I cut up with the butter that I microwaved and then mashed together. 

Also added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. 

I used an 8” square glass Pyrex baking dish that I liked, and covered tightly with aluminum foil. I placed it in a big roasting pan and poured boiling water around it from the kettle and cooked at 350F for an hour.

The blog is great, with step by step pictures of ingredients.

And a recipe of how to make fermented tomatoes:

&gt; The red acid is tomato acid, with the mellow sour taste, light red color, and delicate fragrance. It is usually made with 5kg of fresh wild tomatoes (which can be replaced by planted tomatoes when the wild ones are not available), placing them in a clean pickle jar after washing, and then adding with 500g of ginger, 250g of garlic, 1kg of red pepper, 500g of refined salt, 100g of glutinous rice flour and 250g of white spirit, then filling the jar with water and capping it for 15 days before used. When using it, the solid raw materials in the pot need to be chopped or grounded into the soft paste by a blender.
&gt;
&gt;Red oleic acid, also known as aromatic acid, is made by frying green pepper (Zao pepper ) with oil until the red oil can be seen, then adding fresh wild tomato and stir-frying, adding soup, boiling, removing residue, and concocting. The taste is heavy, sour and spicy, with bright red.</td><td>2020-08-17 17:08:11 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>599</td><td>Christmas Recipe Research</td><td>I’ve got a handful of interesting ingredients, including goose, chestnuts and plantains.

From [Catalan Cuisine](https://allthebest.recipes/t/catalan-cuisine-1998-by-colman-andrews/350), pg 66.

This is the recipe I make the most from this cookbook. I don't really follow the recipe at all. I can skip the the bacon and ham to make it vegetarian, and stretch it with red peppers. Chorizo or other strong and spicy meats go well here too. I often add a goodly amount of pepper, too.

I also use many more tomatoes, usually making a sofregit first as the flavourful base. Canned fire roasted tomatoes add good flavours, or fresh roma tomatoes that cook down nicely.

## Ingredients

* 60g / 2 oz thick cut bacon, cut into 1cm/1/2 inch cubes
* 30g / 1 oz cured ham (proscuitto or Black Forest type), diced or julienne strips
* 2 onions, chopped
* 1 tomato, seeded and grated
* 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 750g / 1 1/2 lb chick peas, cooked
* salt and pepper
* 250 ml / 8 fl oz Garlic Mousseline (pg 28)

## Garlic Mousseline
_Mussolina d'All_

* 12 cloves garlic
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 egg yolks (or 1 egg yolk and 1 whole egg)
* 250 ml / 8 fl oz mild extra-virgin olive oil

The first time I made this mousseline, I made it with raw cloves -- skipping the first instruction to roast them. I have made it with roast garlic, but mostly I run it throw the food processor with raw cloves.

I've also made it vegan with a mix of dijon mustard and nutritional yeast and corn starch.</td><td>2020-03-14 21:20:55 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>910</td><td>Indian-Spiced Short Ribs Recipe</td><td>https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/indian-spiced-short-ribs

Scotch bonnet as a very spicy hot pepper used to taste.

## Curry Powder

https://recipegoldmine.com/worldcaribbean/trinidadian-curry-powder.html

* 4 tablespoons cumin seeds
* 2 tablespoons whole coriander seeds
* 1 tablespoon cloves
* 1 tablespoon poppy seeds
* 1 tablespoon mustard seeds
* 2 tablespoons ground cayenne pepper
* 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
* 2 tablespoons star anise
* 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds
* 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
* 4 tablespoons ground turmeric
* 4 tablespoons ground ginger

Rachael is not a fan of star anise so I’m leaving that out. 

Madras style curry powder and in general adding more turmeric seems to be common. 

## Green Seasoning

This is a bit like Trinidadian pesto. It’s lots of fresh herbs / greens. Pimento peppers are called for, can be substituted with a red bell pepper — not meant to be spicy, adds sweetness and depth.

This is the half batch after 2 days. I filtered the other half on day 3. 

I didn’t de-chlorinate the water and wasn’t sure if I got any fermentation at all — but you can see the fizz when filling the bottle. 

I didn’t have to really burp the bottles at all. Just filter into a bottle and drink!

I like the flavour. The very little ginger I used didn’t really come through at all. 

Cardamom pods were the main additional flavouring. This came through with nice floral / vanilla notes. 

For my taste, a little too sweet: I’ll do less sugar next time.

Fernando asked:

&gt; Any ester-y (nail polish) or phenols (clove and bandaids)?

Thinking about it and trying to describe the flavour / aroma, I think there is some cloves and nail polish hints — like some unaged, white whiskey that I’ve had (aka moonshine).

Reading some other instructions, the environment should be warmer (20-24 degrees), and could add some beer to help accelerate fermentation.

I’m working on [resurrecting the Forage Sourdough Starter](https://allthebest.recipes/t/forage-sourdough-starter-bread-recipes/476/) and found this recipe as something to do with the discard. 

I’m not much of a baker, and it’s definitely not pretty baking, but it ended up tasty so I’m happy with it. 

## Cake

* 1 cup (227g) sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard
* 1 cup (227g) milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) or evaporated milk
* 2 cups (241g) [King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/king-arthur-unbleached-all-purpose-flour-3-lb)
* 1 1/2 cups (298g) granulated sugar
* 1 cup (198g) vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons [vanilla extract](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/pure-vanilla-extract-16-oz)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 3/4 cup (64g) [natural cocoa](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/natural-cocoa-16-oz)
* 1 teaspoon [espresso powder](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/espresso-powder-3-oz), optional
* 2 large eggs

For milk, I only had cream so did 1/2 cup of cream thinned with half cup of water. 

![image|500x500](upload://A7Ix2ybjPj5RiGIGDEv2t7uiMNu.jpeg) 

The instructions were very good. The chocolate sugar oil egg mixture was very thick, and it went gloopy when mixed with the sourdough. 

I put a teaspoon of ground coffee in (not powder).

Dutch cocoa powder is what I had so used that. 

## Icing

* 6 cups (680g) confectioners' sugar
* 12 tablespoons (170g) butter, room temperature
* 1/2 cup (113g) plain yogurt or buttermilk
* 1 tablespoon + 1 1/2 teaspoons [espresso powder](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/espresso-powder-3-oz)
* 1 tablespoon (14g) water, hot

The icing I completely made up and didn’t do the chocolate drizzle.

I only used 3 cups of icing sugar. I used less butter. I didn’t have yogurt or buttermilk — so I used skim milk powder, juice from one fresh lemon, and added the zest from the lemon. I added a cup of shredded coconut. 

As you can see it’s not a pretty cake and it didn’t totally set. 

The chocolate part is fluffy and deep dark chocolate flavour. The coconut chunks are a bit of weird texture, and the lemon takes it in a weird direction.

![trinidad_garlic_pork_575_2|575x380](upload://udBYyLQE2wFq8wmhB3M0BG0XrjD.jpeg) 

The small tropical island of Trinidad has passed through the hands of 22 European occupiers since Christopher Columbus claimed it for the Spanish in 1498, accidentally discovering it on his third voyage to the New World.

Portugal was never an occupying force but one of the country’s classic dishes Carne de Vinha d’Alhos is deeply rooted in Trinidad’s culture as a traditional Christmas dish known as Calvinadage or Garlic Pork.

How Portuguese food found itself entrenched in the local eating habits can be explained primarily by migration of Portuguese labourers from Madeira in 1834 who were lured by the promise of a better life during a period of famine, unemployment and religious persecution. However, by the late 1800s many people of Portuguese origin left Trinidad for Brazil, the USA and Europe. As a result, Trinidad’s Garlic Pork has become one of the lasting symbols of Portuguese ethnicity in the region.

The Portuguese root dish Carne de Vinha d’ Alhos involves marinating over a few days followed by a slow braise. Trinidad’s Garlic Pork shortens the process with a quick shallow fry.

Apple cider vinegar (rather than wine) is used as a souring agent, and local alterations include chadon beni, an edible plant (also known as ngo gai, culantro or sawtooth herb), lots of thyme, and habanero chilies for heat.

Prep time: 20 mins

Cook time: 1 hour 30 mins

Total time: 1 hour 50 mins

Preparation involves pickling pork with vinegar and aromatics, then leaving it all to cure in a sealed jar for a few days, followed by a quick pan fry until the meat is golden brown. The result is crispy, tender chunks of meat, sharply acidic, deeply infused with garlic, herbs and chili heat.

Why am I making cassava flour brownies? Because I bought some [Otimo manioc / cassava flour a while back at Santa Barbara](https://allthebest.recipes/t/santa-barbara-market-on-commercial/365/2) and have been wondering what to make with it. 

Most places say you can sub cassava flour 1:1 for wheat flour. 

Most of the recipes I found were overly focused on being gluten free or paleo or vegan, which I guess is how this often gets used. 

## Ingredients 

* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/3 cup plus 1 TBSP cassava flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 cup dark chocolate chips (6 oz), divided
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter or ghee**
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar (brown, white or coconut)
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

---

As with much of my baking, it wasn’t straight forward ;)

I subbed a block of milk chocolate Callebaut that I shaved off to get a cup of. 

I used half (solid) coconut oil and half salted butter. 

Used only 2/3 cup of turbinado sugar. 

I put the vanilla extract into the chocolate and oil and sugar and it ended up being lumpy. But once I let it cool and added in the 2 eggs and keep whisking it, it did smooth a lot better. 

I added about a 1/4 cup of shredded coconut in with the dry ingredients. 

Even without the coconut, the dry ingredients didn’t totally blend. 

I cooked for 18 minutes and it was still completely liquid when I checked. At 22 minutes it had risen more but was still very molten. 

I let it go another 8-10 minutes and it seemed done.

After cooling for 45 minutes, here’s the slightly collapsed lava and two cut pieces.

![image|375x500](upload://oVwf3ycoflEpfEvq8gpE4BzsBGE.jpeg) 

Now I need to do some research on how to prepare them.

Skipper Otto [introduced them back in Dec 2017](https://skipperotto.com/introducing-scallops/):

&gt; Wild BC scallops are abundant, sustainable, and Ocean Wise recommended! Did you know there was a wild fishery for them? Most people probably don’t! And if there ever was a fishing family uniquely positioned to advocate for the sustainable harvest of these shellfish, it’s Melissa and Joel.
&gt;
&gt; A multi-generational fisherman, Joel began fishing scallops in 2015 alongside his uncle. His wife, Melissa, a marine biologist, recently became involved in helping the family market their catch. According to [Melissa and Joel’s website](https://www.wildscallop.org/about-us), “the harvest of scallops began as an experimental fishery in 2001.  Joel’s Aunt and Uncle were a part of the experimental fishery for over 15 years and were dedicated to developing environmentally sound fishing practices.  By 2009 Fisheries and Oceans Canada began the process of developing an Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) for the commercial harvest of scallops.” And the family has been fishing scallops responsibly ever since.

And the fishermen, West Coast Wild Scallops, have a [recipe page on their site](https://www.wildscallop.org/recipes) with basic recipes.

Also from the fishermen:

&gt; We harvest two wild species of scallops, Pink and Spiny scallops, found off of Vancouver Island, BC.  They are also commonly known as 'Swimming', 'Pink', or 'Singing' scallops. They are significantly smaller than the species commonly eaten.  They have a beautiful and colourful shell, measuring up to 8 cm (3 in.) across.

A Quadra Island supplier has [usage tips and recipes on their website](http://www.swimmingscallops.com/use.htm) -- several sites seem to say to cook them like clams or mussels:

&gt; Swimming Scallops are cooked frozen.  ***DO NOT THAW***  prior to cooking. Do not remove mantle. Swimming Scallops are cooked and served like mussels.
&gt;
&gt;Steam frozen scallops in steam, boiling water, or broth for 3 - 4 minutes. Once the shells open, the scallops are ready for eating. While cooking turn the contents of the pot so the scallops on the bottom can be free of the weight of the scallops on top and can therefore open up.

---

It turns out to be really hard to search for, since most scallops are bay scallops or larger sea scallops, both sold out of the shell.

"Swimming scallops" seems to be the general term for these wild BC scallops, with a mix of pink and spiny swimming scallops being what I have.

What I had in mind was an orange juice, garlic, fresh basil sauce that is served cold over fish that I thought was maybe Brazilian, but I haven’t been able to find anything about it now that I’m searching. And in any case, I turned it into a pan sauce!

This is Yellow Rockfish filet from [Skipper Otto](https://allthebest.recipes/t/skipper-otto-community-supported-fishery/374). 

For the sauce mixture, I juiced one large orange, including getting some of the pulp in there. Two Tbsp dried basil. Two garlic cloves grated on the micro plane to turn to a paste. A little bit of apple cider vinegar. A Tbsp of olive oil. A Tbsp of maple syrup. Whisked with a fork. 

I put canola oil and 2 Tbsp of butter into a pan and heated it on high heat.

I cut the one large filet in half, added salt and green pepper, and put the pieces in the hot oil + butter in the pan skin side down. 

I moved the pieces around and swirled the pan to prevent sticking.

When the butter started to brown, I added in 2 Tbsp of mirin and let it steam off a little. 

I then poured the sauce in, keeping it on high heat. I ladled the sauce over the top of the fish but didn’t flip it. As the sauce started to reduce, I lowered the heat to medium, continuing to spoon hot sauce over the top of the fish. 

Added a little more salt to the sauce and the fish. Served over basmati rice with lots of delicious sauce.</td><td>2020-06-08 04:15:11 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>608</td><td>Christmas Orange Goose, Chestnut Stuffing, and Sides</td><td>I also made two kinds of hearts.

In general, the paler or darker the color, the sweeter it is.[ *[clarification needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)* ] In Southeast Asia, the black ones are nicknamed "Black Pearl" or "Black Diamond", while the very pale greenish-white ones, called "Pearl", are among the highest priced ones in fruit markets. The fruit is often served uncut, but with the core removed, to preserve the unique bell-shaped presentation. In the cuisine of [Indian Ocean islands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_in_the_Indian_Ocean), the fruit is frequently used in salads, as well as in lightly [sautéed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ing)dishes. It is mainly eaten as a fruit and also used to make pickles ([chambakka achar)](http://secretindianrecipe.com/recipe/kerala-style-chambakka-acharkerala-style-love-apple-pickle). In the [Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines), its local name is  *macopa*  (it's ancient name before colonialism, is 'dambo').[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_samarangense#cite_note-morton-2)Because of their similarity in appearance, it is often confused with  *tambis*  ( *[Syzygium aqueum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_aqueum)* ),[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_samarangense#cite_note-5) although the latter is more commonly cultivated.

I substituted a few things (which didn’t go well), but the biggest issue was that the squash didn’t taste good!

It wasn’t sweet, and it didn’t taste like chestnut. 

![image|640x500](upload://yHBvJb6xGJnhKY7qON7TokBzLGu.jpeg) 

I cut off the top quarter and scooped out the thick seeds.

![image|500x500](upload://xub9hG5UKGuQwNxZNsTK3MM4gWE.jpeg) 

It looks like something that would be great stuffed or filled!

![image|500x500](upload://10w05FZVC0bDRoAEva46h4YM8is.jpeg) 

Cream rather than heavy cream. Dried thyme, salt &amp; fresh black pepper. A little more Dijon because I like Dijon.

What to use as thickener? How about some polenta? In case you’re wondering, this is the wrong answer. I can picture a squash filled with cheesy, creamy polenta, but stirring it into some cream and cooking it inside the squash is not how you get there. 

I had some leftover boiled potatoes and put them in. Cheese and potatoes and cream? Right idea, except you also put polenta in. 

The cheese was a grated old Gouda, not Gruyere as called for. Meh. Any sort of cheese could probably work. 

Into the oven on a pie plate with some water in the bottom, with the squash lid placed back on. 

![image|500x500](upload://tZHMWKswyzqJjkrumMbQ54YnqMr.jpeg) 

Not looking too bad! I threw some good grated parmigiano on top and back in the oven uncovered.

---

Well, cut up the squash ladled in this cheese not-cooked polenta potato cream nightmare. 

The sauce... was actually better than the flavour of the squash! It wasn’t sweet, there was no hint of chestnut flavour. 

The skin was tender, the squash might have cooked another 10min or so but I like it a bit al dente rather than falling apart. But all that didn’t matter, because the squash tasted bad. 

Well, I guess there’s a reason we don’t see a lot of Red Kuri here in Vancouver.

We’ll call “North” Commercial Drive north of 1st. This would include Grandview-Woodlands area

Havana

The area west of Woodland Park and south of Hastings is an industrial area that is starting to get a few little mixed use food production places.

Timbertrain Depot is probably the best coffee in the area. Has “Stadium” seating inside, but not a place to hang out. Get your beans here or a great drink, as well as really good baked goods, breakfast sandwiches, and even recently banh mi sandwiches. Go sit in Woodland Park!

Porchlight Press does letterpress printing and other custom print jobs. They have a few really nice cards, notebooks, and other paper goods you can walk in and buy.

Around the corner is the Earnest Ice Cream scoop shop, with a little parklet.

On East Georgia, Coho Commissary is new. Has a cafe inside serving Elysian coffee. A few small tables inside, some really nice picnic tables outside. Croissants, fresh baked bread, and a few sandwiches.

Woodland Park is a big park with a neighbourhood garden and lots of places for laying out on the grass.

Adanac Street, a key east-west bike route, goes along the southern edge of Woodland Park. It has two breweries in the block just west of the park. Bomber Brewing and Off the Rail. There are multiple food trucks that are starting to regularly park there to feed the beer drinkers.

To finish off this corner of the map, the north west corner has Pink Pearl Restaurant, which is a classic big Chinese dining hall style restaurant, with dim sum on weekends including steam carts being pushed around.

Andina Brewing is one of many breweries with tasting rooms in the area.

South, back along busy Clark Street, you’ll find the classic Truck Stop Cafe. Classic diner with all day breakfasts, burgers and fries, club sandwiches, and a few Chinese dishes on special.

West of Clark from there is where many artist studios are. The Mergatroid building is one studio building, and just across from there are the giant and famous Parker Street Studios.

While Clark is busy and not nice to walk along, Strange Fellows Brewing is absolutely worth visiting. My favourite beer in the area, and they often have various art and lifestyle markets and events they host as well.

The main strip of Commercial Drive starts at Venables. Right south of Venables you’ll find a cluster of great stuff. Kin Kao, refined Thai food that is excellent for dine in and take out. Downlow Chicken, always packed, take your order and go eat in Woodland Park. On the other side of the street is Bump &amp; Grind Cafe, a nice place to sit and work or relax.

Choices is a good all around grocery story, including a basic meat, poultry, and fish section. Bread products are boring, fruit &amp; vegetables are just OK. Various natural / organic / vegan stores are all around.

Moja Coffee is usually pretty packed, so more of a good place for people watching than sitting and working at.

Kulinarya is a fantastic Filipino restaurant, one of the best in the city. 

Havana has the best patio on The Drive. Brunch or lunch outside for sure. Cuban food, and a little Theater / performance space too.

Pop up to Victoria from here to get to Via Tevere Pizzeria, one of the top 3 pizza places in the city. Always packed, you can get take out, but really eating in is a fantastic experience.

Santa Barbara Market is where everyone on The Drive shops. Really good fruits and vegetables, and in season lots of stuff in giant containers in from the Fraser Valley and Okanagan. Great deli counter with charcuterie and cheeses. No meat other than some sausages and bacon at the deli counter. Good selection of breads, lots of basics in canned goods and most other things you’ll need.

Lívia Bakery is new and so awesome. Excellent bakery, excellent pastries, excellent coffee. Brunch, lunch, dinner. Cocktails and drinks in the evenings too.

Tatsu is my favourite sushi on The Drive. Really creative presentation, super fresh, all the classics, and yeah, you’ll just be amazed at how some of it is presented.

Magnet Home Hardware is the everything store. Really good cooking (and beer brewing!) equipment, as well as a big garden section. Over on Victoria and south is Figaro’s Garden store which has indoor and outdoor plants and pots of all kinds.

Babylon Cafe is the best shawarma on The Drive.

Across the street, Norman’s Fruit &amp; Salad has massive amounts of fresh fruits and veggies usually for pretty cheap.

La Mezcaleria is fancy and super tasty Mexican food and cocktails.

Right at first, don’t forget about The Bench Bakehouse, another one of the excellent bakeries in the area. Really, should be called Yeast Van not just for beer brewing, but also for bakeries!

Teleporting back north all the way to Powell, you’ll find The Narcissus coffee shop. Small bits of lunch fare, good coffee, really great chill place to hang out and read or work out of.

Right next door is Odd Society Spirits.

Keep going along Powell and you reach Port Town. A whole row of excellence at the foot of Victoria. The Pie Shoppe, Straight &amp; Marrow is replacing Bistro Wagon Rouge and is going to be excellent, plus Aleph Middle Eastern. Across the street is JJ Bean, and then Scandilicious for waffles for breakfast, brunch, and lunch.

Don’t forget about the giant tasting room with food at Parallel 49 Brewing.

Also, if you turn left on Wall Street, is a chill street with little mini parks all along it until you reach New Brighton Park and the outdoor pool there.

Then there is Pallet Coffee Roasters, which has food and coffee and a couple of tucked away areas to work out of. 

In the little strip mall on Hastings at Lakewood you’ll find Pacific Bread Company, rounding out the excellent bakeries. Classic French pastries and breads, as well as macrons. Pizzas and fresh sandwiches for lunch too. 7 Eleven, too, for your summer Slurpees.

Before you leave that corner, there’s Mr. Red Cafe, northern style Vietnamese that is excellent. Not far away is Pandora Park which is really nice and has a community garden in it too.

At that point you’re firmly in Hastings Sunrise, and at Nanaimo and Hastings are lots more shopping and stores, including Donald’s Market. Other than Santa Barbara, this would be the everything grocery store that most people shop at. Good prices and basically anything you want. Heading farther east from there is a whole other set of shops in Hastings-Sunrise.

OK, let’s finish off Nanaimo Street by pointing out Columbus Meats, one of the best butcher shops in the city. Italian, been around for ~40 years. Across the street is the Half Baked Cookie Company, for cookies and pies and cakes.

Back up over on Victoria is Bosa Foods. Classic Italian grocery story. Meats, cheese, frozen goods, lots of oils and spices and canned and pickled things, full deli counter with prepared foods. Plus Italian housewares and cookware.</td><td>2020-07-18 17:40:26 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>732</td><td>Basic Quick Bread Recipe, Savoury or Sweet - Baker Bettie</td><td>https://bakerbettie.com/basic-quick-bread-recipe-sweet-or-savory/

In a high sided pan, I sautéed half an onion in some oil until starting to brown. Added a little butter for richness and then added and sautéed three diagonal sliced carrots. 

Added a cup of water and kept on medium high heat. Added salt, some maple syrup, and a little apple cider vinegar, as well as some balti. 

Added a can of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of sliced grape tomatoes, and a tsp of chicken bouillon. Turned down to simmer.

Added two packages of frozen hand pulled noodles. Added water so noodles were more covered and brought to boil. Stirred to break apart noodles and have the tomatoes melt into boiling broth. 

Added chicken thigh on top and served.

I've got a duck and a goose, and I'm cooking them tomorrow.

I think the Simple Recipes "How to Cook a Goose" which removes the breast is a good method, because I'm packaging things up for my parents to pick up and finish at home:

https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_roast_a_goose/

&gt; Both ducks and geese are red meat birds—meaning the breasts of both need to be served medium-rare. That’s pink, or 140-150°F for those of you with thermometers.

&gt; With my method, you roast the goose for a while, then slice off the whole breast and finish it in a pan once the legs are done. That way you still get a nice roasted flavor on the whole goose, and you get crispy skin and you get properly pink breast meat.

I can follow this same method for the duck.

I have some meyer lemons and sherry that will get used. Main thing will be that I'll salt everything tonight.

I hadn't really thought of stuffing. There is some panettone that is leftover from Rachael's trifle making, that I'll mix with some onions and dried apricots in the duck I think.

Lightly breaded with a gluten-free rice flour mixture. Chilli oil, a thick aioli, and served over shredded cabbage. Tasty, I wish it wasn’t breaded, and way too much aioli smear on the plate. 

I understand that not breading squid means it’s too weird for many people. I would love this grilled. Makes me want to experiment with some Humboldt squid dishes.

I flipped the goose and cooked for another 40 minutes, then cut everything apart and took all the meat off the bones. 

Half for us, half for my parents. 

The skin is nice and salty and crisp. 

## Duck

Duck was also salted over night. Ended up rubbing with sumac, crushed brown cardamom, nutmeg, ground cloves, as well as rubbing with a meyer lemon and finishing with koji salt. 

![image|375x500](upload://ulOR5K6zM7vRONhvjRaemk8tQHe.jpeg) 

Put it in at 375 / door open. This is after 1hr or so?

![image|374x500](upload://AsmwzW4VnHeXMZIHnNFsphsKqEH.jpeg) 

I was juggling stuffing, Brussels sprouts, and roast veggies at this point and ran out of steam. I knew the breasts would overcook but didn’t have time to pause and so the duck breakdown. 

I flipped it so the bottom would brown, which took another 45 minutes or so plus some light broil. 

Took the duck apart to share with my parents. Legs and wings were great, breast was over cooked, but everything crispy salty delicious.

Spices didn’t come through that strongly, just some floral notes from the cardamom and lemony hints from the sumac. 

Paused to package everything and share with parents. 

I skipped lunch other than some cooked goose pieces so we had dinner at 4pm!

## Goose Breast and actual Dinner

I put a Tbsp of reserved goose fat in a pan and put the half goose breast in it. Pushed it down and kept moving around the pan. 

Briefly seared meat side down — you can see how red it was. 

![image|666x500](upload://sS03AbM1O1uzQrEifkP95RLeBD.jpeg) ![image|500x500](upload://tmNqUKlyVjlNOc8cW1QhvJhEh9b.jpeg) 

I salted with koji salt and we sat down to eat. 

This is definitely a top 5 meat that I’ve made. Extremely happy with how it turned out. Crisp and crackly skin layer, soft fat layer underneath, and light pink goose breast underneath. 

![image|500x500](upload://m9QQuvyLtTzmXB1L59XJitumb6c.jpeg) 

Here’s the full plate.
* Spätzle noodles made by my mom
* Brussels sprouts sautéed with smoked pork loin and garlic, finished with lemon juice, sherry vinegar, and a bit of maple syrup
* Stuffing with goose giblets, onions, green leek tops, zest of a meyer lemon, dried apricots, diced celery, thyme, and a citrus panettone as the bread, plus goose fat
* roasted sweet potatoes, celery, parsnips, fennel - done in goose fat with a bit of salt and a bit of maple syrup

The sweet potatoes and parsnips were good. The celery, which I cut diagonally, ended up shriveling up. Rachael’s comment “I’m not eating dried up leaves”. 

![image|375x500](upload://vu2reeNZ1neD6zZG85OAWoLKENQ.jpeg) 

This is what was leftover AFTER Rachael and I ate. I snacked a bit later in the evening - ate the goose wing because it wouldn’t fit in the leftover container ;)

Oh yeah. Used a stick blender to blend the stock into gravy. Balanced with red wine, sherry, and some maple syrup. I usually make a flour and oil base and use stock and get a very think gravy. This was tasty as is but obviously a little thin. 

First time using the big pan with the rack. Way more even and crisp poultry cooking. Cooking with the door open isn’t great. This is a half sheet, a quarter sheet would be fine for the duck and similarly sized chickens. 

Duck and goose breast can be bought separately and are obviously way less complicated and messy. And my new Sous vide should come in handy with those too.</td><td>2020-12-25 05:13:32 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>727</td><td>German Bread Dumplings - Semmelknödel</td><td>I had a tail end of a dry baguette and decided to try and make some bread dumplings.

https://www.daringgourmet.com/semmel-knoedel-german-bread-dumplings/

* 11 ounces of white crusty bread (traditionally Brötchen/crispy bread rolls are used) , left to sit out for a few days to get hard and then diced into small cubes
* Note:  It's more convenient to use bags of unseasoned bread stuffing - it's already cubed, simply let it dry out a little longer.  (I do not advise using croutons though as they're too hard.)
* 1 cup hot milk
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 3/4 cup very finely diced yellow onion
* 4 strips bacon, diced and fried until crisp , optional for a variation called Speckknödel (Bacon Bread Dumplings)
* 2 large eggs , lightly beaten with a fork
* 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
* 1 teaspoon salt (you can use less if using bacon)
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
* breadcrumbs, as needed

## Quick German Recipes

https://www.quick-german-recipes.com/german-bread-dumplings.html

* 10 -12 slices stale bread (about 8 rolls) 
* 1½ cups milk, lukewarm
* 1 tsp salt
* 3 slices bacon, chopped
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
* 2 eggs
* breadcrumbs as needed

This was hard to scale down to a small amount of leftover bread. I used too much milk and then tried to fix it with flour. I also used onion powder and didn’t add parsley. So basically — a completely different recipe!

I did simmer for 20 minutes but they didn’t really seem done. I put them in a cast iron pan with a little butter and baked for 15min per side, plus a little broil at the end to brown. 

Tasty, but will need to actually get the quantities right next time ;)</td><td>2020-05-03 18:34:34 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>723</td><td>Pho Japolo - Family Run Vietnamese</td><td>I ordered a second time from here today.

I had schug along with [harissa](https://wiki.bmann.ca/harissa) at [The Exchange restaurant in LA](https://wiki.bmann.ca/journal/2018-04-05-some-la-eats).

&gt; “The thing about schug that’s awesome,” chef Michael Solomonov of Philadelphia’s Zahav begins, “is that you find it alongside harissa on every table in Israel.” The fiery green chile sauce hails from the Yemenites who brought it to the region in the 1950s, contrasting the roasted red chile harif (hot sauce) from North Africa. “I think that’s interesting from a sociological point of view; that flavor has popped in from everywhere.”

&gt; * Tasting Table, [Pour Some Schug on Me](https://www.tastingtable.com/cook/national/schug-hot-sauce-michael-solomonov)

## Recipe

* 1 cup parsley
* 1 cup cilantro
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon ground coriander
* 1 tablespoon ground cardamom
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* 20 serrano chiles, stems removed
* 4 garlic cloves
* 1 cup canola oil

Via [Michael Solomonov, Tasting Table](https://www.tastingtable.com/cook/recipes/schug-secret-weapon-recipe)

I made this with very minor modifications. I used 5 jalapenos, all seeds removed, and I used grape seed oil rather than canola oil. I also didn't have any ground coriander so I ground some coriander seeds that I had. Not very spicy, nice and tangy, and I like the saltiness of this.

##  May 12, 2019

![](upload://iTiTzp547CIRhJLwNT9R90RHhFU.jpeg)

Made this again, this time with 2 jalapenos and one Thai red chilli. I did have canola oil, but once again used fresh ground coriander seeds. I'm not sure that my ground cardamom is really coming through in the flavours.

I also made a small second batch with just the stems of the parsley and cilantro, 2 garlic cloves, 2 red chillis, and juice of 3 fresh lemons, and a tablespoon or 2 of canola oil. This ended up more like a chimichurri sauce and very liquid.

##  June 23, 2019

I decided to see if I could make this with a smaller quantity. And, I actually found the serrano chiles.

Since I was making a sort of half portion, I just used a bunch of cilantro. I was using up some peeled garlic cloves, so that ended up being 8 - 12. Lime juice instead of lemon juice. I'm not convinced that the particular ground cardamom I use really does add any flavour, but I did use it. Finally, previously I had seeded the jalapenos I used, but other than cutting off the stem, I just roughly chopped the serranos and put them straight in. Well, it turns out when you massively increase the raw garlic and don't seed the chiles -- this becomes a really spicy sauce. It's still very tasty, and I now feel comfortable riffing on this base recipe.</td><td>2020-05-12 15:50:42 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>866</td><td>Leg of Lamb with Oranges</td><td>![image|500x500](upload://ou7J4vbtuxbTpfByYrMCU2OZKkD.jpeg) 

I did make a paste.

* I had a 1/2 cup of grape seed oil leftover from frying plantains last night so started with that. 
* Added zest and juice from one orange.
* 2 cloves garlic, which were kind of jumbo so more like 4-5 regular cloves. 
* 1 onion
* 1 gala apple
* 2 tsp salt 
* 2 tsp black pepper
* 1 Tbsp paprika
* 1 Tbsp cumin seeds
* 1 Tbsp red miso
* 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard
* 1 Tbsp oregano
* 1/2 cup dates

Slathered it all over the leg after scoring the fat. Put it in the oven uncovered at 450F

![image|666x500](upload://2cziVi9UWvdDybixIaiua5mSsLl.jpeg) 

After 30min at 450 the smears of paste were getting dark so I added liquid (water used to rinse out the paste from food processor), one large sweet carrot, and a leek. 

Sealed it in aluminum foil.

![image|375x500](upload://9iEA5hFUJ5dnXUnTN1vZsCww33f.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://xQyckzvrtKJObtvv0WCZYPgAesU.jpeg) 

After 2 hours at 330F under foil, this is what it looked like. Took off the foil and increased heat to 400F and put it back in the oven for 40min. The crust thickened and darkened nicely. 

![image|666x500](upload://ejIbGdADCEZsK7E9udciBigRLHo.jpeg) 

I liked the flavour. The lamb itself was just OK. Should have gone in a Dutch oven and been more sealed and probably cook for another hour over low heat. Pieces of lamb with broiled crust were really good.</td><td>2020-10-12 21:13:39 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>768</td><td>Bruce &amp; Clarke Grocery Delivery</td><td>https://www.bruceandclark.ca/grocery

First was the Japanese simmered taro (thanks Fernando!)

![image|500x500](upload://cxr1MrGSuZzz6pCT98RZsLe5RWV.jpeg) 

I didn’t have any sake, but the Sherinngham Distillery white whiskey worked fine ;)

And of course, these aren’t young small tubers. I didn’t notice any slime. The texture is VERY dry. They hold their shape but you can use a fork to mash them, so definitely need liquid. 

Second was thin taro “fries” baked in the oven with olive and a mix of koji salt (which isn’t very salty) and kelp salt. Like yams, you have to be careful between burning and soggy when you bake.

Served with radish pickles, kimchi, and pickled beets, plus some taco beef and pulled pork leftovers. 

Lastly, taro custard. I used the taro bun filling as a guide, so cubed the taro and boiled it in 3 cups of water.

Drained and reserved 1/3 cup cooking liquid. It was easy to mash with a potato masher.

Added in 1/4 cup of sugar and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.

Then I beat an egg with 1/3 cup of cream and mixed it into the mashed taro. I put it back on low heat and used a whisk to keep stirring. 

The finally mixture is nice and smooth and sweet, quite a bit like chestnut. I’m going to let it cool and see what that does to texture.</td><td>2020-05-11 02:30:37 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>786</td><td>Rhubarb shrub June 2020</td><td>![image|500x500](upload://zTuENthaVf1vOxqfPHaHs4HQaNL.jpeg) 

Day 2. This actually liquified very quickly on the first day already. That lovely pink colour nicely leached out already.</td><td>2020-06-12 01:05:24 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>788</td><td>Rhubarb shrub June 2020</td><td>![image|500x500](upload://1RqDQB2A3YSWNCiWlMH1AqXsXzo.jpeg) 

Final product. Filtered out the liquid, then simmered the rhubarb chunks with white wine vinegar and some water, and mashed it through a sieve. 

Too much vinegar for Rachael. This would have been nice with a milder champagne vinegar. Still has a lovely pink colour and strong rhubarb taste to mix with water or a cocktail.</td><td>2020-06-15 03:41:55 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>809</td><td>Eggplant and okra in a peanut coconut sauce</td><td>I ordered 2lbs of Chinese eggplants which is a lot of eggplants to use up.

![image|500x500](upload://7yXZgVjEUi6pQVXOF0Dzsf8iMcg.jpeg) 

I sautéd 3/4 of an onion, sliced, in sesame oil. I used a micro grater to finely mince a big knob of garlic and two cloves of garlic and put it in with the onions. 

Cut the tops and tips off and then cut in half 2 cups of okra.

Crushed 1/2 cup of blanched salted peanuts, added a little grapeseed oil.

Chopped up 3 Chinese eggplants into 1” cubes. Added 1.5 tsp red chill flakes.

Added sushi vinegar and soy sauce and kept stirring. Added 3/4 of a can of coconut milk.

Corrected with some more vinegar and then added a bit of regular salt.

Let cook until eggplant is tender but not mushy.

I’m happy with how the flavours turned out. I think I would have liked it more without the coconut milk, but it was an open can that needed using up.

Without coconut milk, I would have kept the heat high and maybe added some maple syrup for sweetness.</td><td>2020-07-22 04:40:01 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>879</td><td>Boiled crab with broccoli</td><td>I think this week is the first time that I have ever paid for crab. 

Childhood crab traps off the dock or a dinghy on Bowen Island, trapped by friends (Lee &amp; Sachi), or caught by hand by friends (James).

I finished off my membership in the [Skipper Otto](https://allthebest.recipes/t/skipper-otto-community-supported-fishery/374) Community Supported Fishery (CSF) by buying 2 crab and picking them up this past Thursday. 

I rode out and back on my bike, much like when I picked up live prawns in the summer.

![image|375x500](upload://2DipSqC3qkANYsTXoAgpnewYEFH.jpeg) 

The crab weighed 3.3lbs for both of them.

I [found a video on humanely killing crab](https://allthebest.recipes/t/how-to-humanely-kill-cook-and-crack-dungeness-crab/482). Since our small apartment kitchen doesn’t really have sharp corners, and I didn’t want to splatter the ground with crab juice, I used a different method. 

I have a large heavy cleaver and drove it through the crab. If we’re going to eat animals we need to be OK with killing them — as humanely as possible. 

I followed the rest of the instructions for cleaning from the video, including reserving the “crab mustard”.

I added garlic, ginger, onions, green peppercorns, bay leaves, and salt to the water and boiled the crab. 

![image|500x500](upload://2jn1d6jGqX33yTwdNvCeyYxcuWj.jpeg) 

I made a bit of sauce by mincing half a small onion, two cloves crushed garlic, and sautéed in a knob of butter. Then added a chopped fresh tomato, black pepper, salt, and juice of a fresh lime, plus a spoonful of sambal oelek. Added the crab mustard and juices and reduced.

Made a little garlic butter, plus had some slices of my homemade sourdough bread that I toasted. 

A few minutes before the crab was finished I added a head of broccoli cut into smaller florets. Gotta have your veggies!

We pulled out our nutcrackers and crab picks and feasted. The crab meat by itself was tender and sweet and delicious and didn’t need anything else. The garlic butter and tomato crab sauce was nice with the bread.

The top shells and scraps as well as the cracked leftover shells went back in the cooking liquid to boil and reduce. I have a crab stock in the freezer that I might join with some prawn shells that I kept.</td><td>2020-11-21 17:56:24 UTC</td></tr><tr><td>810</td><td>Fava beans are complicated</td><td>![image|500x500](upload://1EMrpTwqH3PSzAdVUwDCaaOsahf.jpeg) 

This plate of fava beans sautéed with onions, bacon, and some fresh lemon juice looks pretty good, but since I don’t really work with fava beans it was... complicated.

Specifically, I popped open the pods and took out the beans and started sautéing them...without taking the bean skins off.

I realized my mistake and then spent 10 minutes burning my finger tips while taking off the skins.

The flavour of the finished dish was pretty tasty, but a high fussiness factor ;)

I also didn’t have yogurt or milk, so used skim milk powder for the liquid. 

The dough definitely didn’t rise enough. Probably a combination of starter that’s not lively enough and not being warm enough.

The good stuff — plus neck and giblets — I put in a ziplock bag with salt and a big bunch of fresh thyme. I let it sit for two hours. 

Separately I took the carcass and scraps into the slow cooker. Added an onion, and two carrots. 

Added Szechuan peppercorns, coriander seeds, and mustard seeds. 

Ended up adding the liver and neck after they cured as they didn’t fit into the confit pan. When the fat + skin was rendered, I added them to the stock too. 

For the confit, I cut up several shallots and 5 cloves of garlic. Some thyme sprigs and some fresh cracked black pepper.

Cardamom [Kouign Amman](https://allthebest.recipes/t/kouign-amman-a-french-buttery-caramelized-sweet-pastry-from-breton/363) — really great cardamom flavour, and maybe even a hint of orange water in there?

I made some at my parents last week and definitely got the fermentation going by leaving the water out overnight.

At home, I’m started a ginger bug with the last bit of the last cardamom tepache, grated ginger, and 2Tbsp of sugar.

Also getting the next batch of tepache going, with 1x pineapple, 2x stalks of rhubarb, a larger knob of ginger, and 1x lemon. Will the rind on the lemon make things too bitter? I used 3/4 cup of turbinado sugar, will check on it tomorrow.
