I decided to cook my parents the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Chick%2520Peas%2520with%2520Garlic%2520Mouselline.html">Chick Peas with Garlic Mouselline</a> dish that I had meant to cook with Rosano.</p><p>As it turned out we made arrangements to take dad to a doctor’s appointment so I finished cooking just in time to leave.  </p><p>Bacon cut up and sautéed until starting to crisp. Adding some olive oil and putting in chopped fresh tomatoes. Chopped up the chorizo and put it in, then chickpeas. Also put in some chopped carrots. Added quite a bit of fresh ground black pepper and then a little white wine vinegar. No added salt because the bacon was very salty. </p><p>Came back and tried it — was pretty tasty! The melted onions do make this a lot tastier. I might actually try making this again for the team — because I can make vegan, and just have chorizo on the side. </p><p>Then I rushed off to meet Heidi at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Leonhardt%2520Restaurant.html">Leonhardt Restaurant</a>.</p><p>We had eaten here before but the whole restaurant and menu was totally changed. </p><p>We had a really great house Italian red wine.</p><p>Shared a “beet carpaccio” with arugula and sheep feta. Bread on the side had nuts and fruit in it and went really nice with the sheep feta. This was a great dish. </p><p>I had the duck breast with squash puree and some sort of vegetables. The duck skin was not crisp and in general not cooked well. </p><p>Heidi had papardelle with Maishänchen and a Gorgonzola sauce. </p><p>Everything was under salted. </p><p>But we did get a second 0.5 L of the wine ;)</p></div>
